This project runs on port 3333 so create a ngrok endpoint using
`ngrok http 3333`

Paste the https url as a value to `serverUrl` in index.js file.

I was using ThunderClient(Alternative of Postman) extension on VS-Code for hitting APIs.
So, recommending to install that and `api.json` file can be imported directly to get most of
the APIs created on thunderclient.

Running the code:
